# AI Innovators Hub — Technical Team Screening Task (2025-26)

## Why this task exists

As we are all aware, Delhi has been consistently ranked among the most polluted capital cities in the world.

PM2.5 and PM10 exposure directly impacts lungs, cognitive performance and long-term public health. As an applied AI club, we want to focus on real-world issues.

This screening task is designed to evaluate if you can:

* work with real-world, slightly messy public datasets
* think clearly, scope a small Minimum Viable Product [MVP]  
* produce a working output in a limited time
* communicate your results cleanly

This is exactly the way we work inside AI Innovators Hub.

## Dataset

Use this public dataset on Kaggle:

**Air Quality Data in India (2015 - 2020)**
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)

You will specifically work on the file:
`city_day.csv`

## Your Task

Use **Delhi data only** and choose **any one** of the two tasks below.

---

### OPTION 1 → Build a Predictor

Task: Predict tomorrow’s PM2.5 value in Delhi based on the previous data.

Minimum Requirements:

* Load & clean the Delhi subset
* Train a prediction model (can be sklearn or pre-trained ML model or even LLM toolchains like Gemini 2.5 Flash etc.)
* Produce a single prediction: **what is PM2.5 the next day after the final date in the data?**  
[The "next day" means: if data ends on 2020-07-01, predict 2020-07-02]
* Show your evaluation / reasoning

---

### OPTION 2 → Build a Simple Intelligent Dashboard / Insight

Task: Generate insights + a small dashboard on “What factor correlates most with PM2.5 in Delhi?”

Minimum Requirements:

* Load & clean the Delhi subset
* Find which pollutant has highest correlation with PM2.5 (or create a ranking)
* Produce an insight: “Which pollutant influences PM2.5 most?”
* Optional bonus: simple web dashboard (streamlit / gradio)

---

## Allowed

* pretrained models
* CSV data wrangling libraries
* any python libs

**Ethics Note:** Using AI tools is allowed, but your submission must reflect your thinking. If your code is fully autogenerated without understanding, we will immediately reject.

## Not Allowed

* submitting a notebook copy-pasted from Kaggle/YouTube/GitHub without any modification

**We will ask**: "Walk me through your code line-by-line" in the interview.
If you can't explain it, you will be disqualified.

---

## Deliverables (mandatory)

Submit a Google Drive or GitHub link with:

* your `.ipynb` notebook (Colab preferred)
* A small README:
  * Which option you selected (1 or 2)
  * What method/model you used
  * What your result was

File naming format (IMPORTANT):

`YourName_AIH_2025_Screening.ipynb`  
example: `Swayam_AIH_2025_Screening.ipynb`

**Important**: Your notebook should run from top to bottom without errors when we open it.

---

## Timeline

**Deadline:** 11:59PM, 18/11/2025 (IST)  
(If you are reading this after this date, you cannot submit.)

## Goal

We don’t expect perfection.

We expect:
* willingness to learn
* ability to complete end-to-end
* ability to explain what you did

Good luck. Build something real.
